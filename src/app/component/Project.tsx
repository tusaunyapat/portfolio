This experience allowed me to strengthen my understanding of modular design and algorithmic efficiency, as I built a complex, interactive game. It demonstrated my ability to manage multiple interconnected components, optimize performance, and develop maintainable codeâ€”a skill set I am eager to bring to new challenges in software development.",
